*Extensible is a javascript library for Flash Professional CS4 & CS5.

Extensible provides wrappers for flash-specific classes used in 
Flash Professional's SpyderMonkey implementation which are, unlike the
built-in classes, extensible.

*Flash to SVG ( flash2svg ) *WIP

Flash to SVG exports SVG images directly from Flash. After
installing flash2svg.mxi, it can be accessed from 'Windows > Other Panels > SVG'.
Currently only still images and sequences are supported. Animated output is in development.

*In Place Cut, Copy, & Paste ( inPlaceClipboard.mxi )

Works just like "copy" or "cut" + "paste in place", but relative to the root timeline
in the current view. For use in copying elements from one timeline (symbol) while in 
'edit-in-place' mode, in order to paste them into another symbol or into the root timeline,.
while maintaining the same global transformations.
